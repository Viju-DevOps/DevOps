# Tasks for the Machine Test

>[!NOTE]
>**Before moving on, carefully follow the directions for each activity.**


1. Access the server using SSH to identify and resolve connectivity issues. 
   
 >Troubleshoot and resolve potential connectivity issues using SSH to access the server. Could you identify and address any issues hindering successful server access? Server IP, Username, and Password will be provided.

2. Determine the server's OS version, available disk space, memory usage, CPU details, and architecture.

 >Retrieve information about the server's operating system version, disk space availability, memory usage, and CPU details.  

3. Troubleshoot and debug issues related to the Nginx website.
   
 >Identify and resolve issues with the Nginx website by troubleshooting and debugging potential issues in its configuration and performance. You should be able to recall the website by IP as well as by providing /web. Example: 192.168.0.56/web

4. Complete the shell script by incorporating steps to upload a file to AWS S3 and verifying its presence in the designated bucket.

 >[Click Here](ShellScript/hello.sh) to visit the shell script . Complete the script by add the step to upload the backup file to the S3 bucket **"devops--db--backup"**.

5. Develop a Terraform script to create an EC2 instance and display its public IP address as part of the Terraform output.

 >Create a Terraform script that establishes an EC2 instance and includes the public IP address as part of the output.
   
6. Create a Dockerfile to facilitate the execution of a JavaScript file and  access it through a web browser.

> Files to dockerize can be accessed [Here](Docker). Before dockerization, it is important to install the dependencies such as node. The command to install node is **npm install** and **npm install express** and the command to run the app **node app.js**.

7. Design an architecture for hosting a Frontend application on AWS, considering robust security measures.
    
>This would test your ability to analyze requirements and design a solution. This reflects your problem-solving skills, which are crucial in real-world scenarios.
