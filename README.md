# Tasks for the Machine Test

>[!NOTE]
>**Before moving on, carefully follow the directions for each activity.**


1. Access the server using SSH to identify and resolve connectivity issues. 
   
 >Troubleshoot and resolve potential connectivity issues using SSH to access the server. Could you identify and address any issues hindering successful server access? Server IP, Username, and Password will be provided.

2. Determine the server's OS version, available disk space, memory usage, CPU details, and architecture.

 >Retrieve information about the server's operating system version, disk space availability, memory usage, and CPU details.  

3. Create a Dockerfile to facilitate the execution of a JavaScript file and push it to github.

> Files to dockerize can be accessed [Here](Docker). Before dockerization, it is important to install the dependencies such as node. The command to install node is **npm install** and **npm install express** and the command to run the app **node app.js**.

4. Create a Jenkins pipeline to build the dokcer image from the Dokcerfile and push the images to ACR.

 >Jenkins URL : **http://172.174.208.166:8080/**  jenkins username & password : tadevops & tadevops , ACR repo: **"tadevops"**.

5. Develop a Terraform script to create an Azure VM and display its public IP address as part of the Terraform output.

 >Create a Terraform script that establishes an Azure VM and includes the public IP address as part of the output.
   

6. Design an architecture for hosting a Frontend application on Azure, considering robust security measures.
    
>This would test your ability to analyze requirements and design a solution. This reflects your problem-solving skills, which are crucial in real-world scenarios.
